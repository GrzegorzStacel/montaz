## General info
As part of the training, I created this site following ~90% of the example on another site
> Unfortunatelly the original site is no longer available

I changed a few things that were implemented differently on the original version of the page.
e.g.
1. The original website based RWD entirely on bootstrap, and I did it with flex as part of the exercises
2. I added other animations and some extra ones
3. I used other libraries:
	* lightboxes
    * owlCarusel2
    * ScrollReveal
